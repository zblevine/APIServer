Some comments/design decisions:

-For avg_len, I found a regex that covers all non-alphanumeric characters
so to get an array of words I just split on that. 

-I couldn't get the server to work if I used single or double quotes in
my JSON input at all. I think JSON treats each of those special cases
in a funny way and causes it not to interpret the input as one string
if either is used.

-I thought it would be easiest if for each endpoint I used a different
data model.

-When returning a most common word, I treated capitalization as irrelevant;
thus, Polish and polish are the same word, even though in this case they
have different meanings. I was willing to sacrifice this rare case in exchange
for allowing for correct capitalization in sentences.

-If a text input was "hey hey hi hi hi", the median word frequency would
be 2.5. I treated this as having no words with median frequency instead of
returning both words.
