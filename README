Some comments/design decisions:

-I run the program in Eclipse. This starts the server. Then I type something
like this in terminal:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text:"
"This is my text input. Yep! Here is another sentence"}'
http://localhost:8080/your/endpoint_here

-If you want to modify the code and run the server again, be sure to
stop the Java program first! I ran into problems connecting when I tried
to run the server while it was still running. Stopping the Java program
will close the server.

-For avg_len, I found a regex that covers all non-alphanumeric characters
so to get an array of words I just split on that. 

-I couldn't get the server to work if I used single or double quotes in
my JSON input at all. I think JSON treats each of those special cases
in a funny way and causes it not to interpret the input as one string
if either is used.

-I thought it would be easiest if for each endpoint I used a different
data model, except the average word length and sentence length; I used the
same AvgLen model for that since each endpoint displays two variables,
input text and average length.

-When returning a most common word, I treated capitalization as irrelevant;
thus, Polish and polish are the same word, even though in this case they
have different meanings. I was willing to sacrifice this rare case in exchange
for allowing for correct capitalization in sentences.

-If a text input was "hey hey hi hi hi", the median word frequency would
be 2.5. I treated this input as having no words with median frequency instead of
returning both words.

-When doing the sentences endpoint, I chose to split sentences on
a period followed by a space, a question mark followed by a space, or
an exclamation point followed by a space. This has one unfortunate consequence;
expressions such as "Mr. Jones" are treated as two sentences. Factorials are
also a problem. I think this method deals with most other cases well.

-I never got to the phone number expression. Here are the forms I
would count:

847-123-5555
(847) 123-5555
(847) 123 5555
(847)123-5555
(847)1235555
(847)123 5555
847.123.5555
847 123 5555
8471235555
